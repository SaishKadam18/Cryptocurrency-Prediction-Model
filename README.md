Cryptocurrency-Prediction-Model
Overview

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict cryptocurrency price trends using historical data. The model is designed to assist investors in making informed decisions.

Features-

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Multiple ML algorithms (e.g., LSTM, XGBoost, Random Forest)

Real-time data fetching using APIs

Visualizations for trend analysis

Model evaluation with accuracy metrics

Installation-

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-prediction-model.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd crypto-prediction-model

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Dataset

The model uses historical cryptocurrency data from platforms like Binance, CoinGecko, or Alpha Vantage. Ensure your dataset includes features such as:

Open, High, Low, Close prices (OHLC)

Trading volume

Market sentiment data (optional but recommended)

Model Architecture

LSTM: Captures sequential trends in data.

XGBoost/Random Forest: Provides strong results for feature-rich data.

Evaluation Metrics

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-Squared (RÂ²)

Results

The model achieves a prediction accuracy of X% with an RMSE of Y. Visualizations are available in the results/ folder.
